## Simple Assembler v1

Dan O’Malley

A basic flex and yacc-based x86 64-bit assembler. This code is largely based on [SimpleCompilerv1](https://github.com/meuer26/SimpleCompilerv1) but using the symbol table from [SimpleCompilerv3](https://github.com/meuer26/SimpleCompilerv3_Student). It was adapted from a compiler-based project to an assembler-based project as flex and yacc are easy to create the parsing needed for complex assembly files.
